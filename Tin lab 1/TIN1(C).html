			Before the beginning of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers <mark>Garamon</mark> and <mark>Tyball</mark> accidentally summon a demon,
			the <mark>Slasher of Veils</mark>, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel.
			Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue.
			However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon.
			Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails;
			Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room.
			Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself,
			and plans to sacrifice <mark>Baron Almric's</mark> daughter, <mark>Arial</mark>, at the doorway to gain entrance.
			In the game's introduction, the ghost of Garamon haunts the <mark>Avatar's</mark> dreams with warnings of a great danger in <mark>Britannia</mark>.
			The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial.
			Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar to be caught by the Baron's guards.
			The guards take him to the Baron, who banishes him to the <mark>Great Stygian Abyss</mark> to rescue Arial.
			After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of <mark>Cabirus's</mark> colony.
			A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language,
			and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.
			However, as he dies, Tyball reveals that he had decided to contain the Slasher of Veils,
			whose prison he had been weakening, within Arial as a way to prevent it from destroying the world.
			Arial asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of Veils from being unleashed,
			and magically teleports back to the surface to evacuate its inhabitants.

			With help from Garamon's ghost, the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano at the base of the Abyss;
			Garamon uses the energy they release to open a portal and send the Slasher of Veils into another dimension.
			The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension,
			but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron's ship as the volcano erupts.
			As the game ends, Garamon's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants of the Abyss to another cave.
